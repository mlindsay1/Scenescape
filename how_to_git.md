HOW TO GIT
==========
#The Beginning...
 - In the git bash console:
 	- "git init"
 	- "git clone https://github.com/rob-meh/Scenescape.git"

#The Pushining
- If you've made changes and want to see which files you;ve changed :
	- " git status "

- To add changes to your commit:
	- "git add [name of the file] "
	- Or to add them all  " git add . "

- Enter "git status " to make sure all the files you wanted to add are added ( they should be green )

- To create the commit 
	- A) Inline method (ez mode) : ' git commit -m "Your commit Message" '
	- B) Outline(?) method (stupid mode) : ' git commit ', THen you write a bunch of bullshit and have to know some vim commands so fuck this method.

- To push your changes:
	- " git push "

The above steps assume you are working on the master branch, you can create your own more volatile branch if you want, but that means you have to merge that branch into master before you push it.

Most of that probably made no sense
