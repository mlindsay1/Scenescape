To Do
•	Expand web server/database users so that we can all access and interact with the database
•	Create and share a Github repository for the Android and PHP code
•	Add events to the database using SQL to insert from the spreadsheet
o	Keep track of what events have been added to avoid duplicate events with unique keys
•	Come up with a list of queries that will be required for working with the database AND in-app activities
•	Determine how we are going to parse the return string from the database
